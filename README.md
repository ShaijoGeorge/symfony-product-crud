This is a Product Management System built using the Symfony PHP framework. It allows users to add, view, edit, and delete products.

Features:
1. Product Listing: Displays all products.
2. Create & Edit Product: We can add or update product details.
3. Delete Product: We can delete products.
4. Reordering Product Numbers: Product IDs remain unique in the database, but the frontend list dynamically reorders numbers upon deletion.
5. Bootstrap UI.
